## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days);
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle.

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package Manager fo JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development Tool focused in performance

### What I've learned

This project was a wonderful source of info and learning material about ReactJS. Not only that, I've also learned how to work with mixins and responsive CSS units, which was a true pain for me to understand.

### Continued development

I'm planning to improve the logic, refactoring and creating more user interaction with the countdown timer.
